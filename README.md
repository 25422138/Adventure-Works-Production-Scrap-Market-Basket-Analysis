---

## 📊 Project Overview

This group project analyzes **production scrap reasons** and **sales order patterns** for Adventure Works Cycles (FY2012–2014).  
Using SQL queries and business analytics, the study identifies manufacturing inefficiencies and cross-selling opportunities, providing actionable recommendations for optimization.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Investigate common **scrap reasons** in bicycle production and propose process improvements.
- Conduct **market basket analysis** on sales orders to uncover product mix trends.
- Quantify **cross-selling potential** and highlight low penetration in non-core categories.
- Recommend **data-driven strategies** to improve production quality and sales performance.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **SQL (T-SQL)**: Complex queries, CTEs, aggregations, market basket analysis
- **Azure Data Studio**: Query execution, database exploration, and reporting
- **PowerPoint / Word**: Business reporting and visualization
- **GitHub**: Portfolio hosting and documentation

## 🔑 Key Findings

- **Production Scrap**: Wheel misalignment and drill errors were the most frequent causes across 300+ work orders.
- **Sales Orders**:  
  - 45% of orders contained only bicycles.  
  - “Bicycles + Accessories” was the most popular combination (25%).  
  - Accessories, clothing, and components had low penetration (25–31%).  
- **Cross-Selling Potential**: Heatmap analysis showed bicycles drive all combination sales.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Production**: Calibrate temperature control systems and introduce real-time monitoring for machining errors.
- **Online Channels**: Develop an **Accessory Recommender** to suggest frequently purchased bundles (e.g., lock + lighting kit).
- **Marketing**: Target newcomers with “one-stop shopping” ads and A/B test free access promotions.
- **Offline Channels**: Create **cycling experience zones** and equip staff with bundle recommendation tools.
